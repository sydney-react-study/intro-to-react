# JSX

React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called `JSX` that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript. This has several benefits. It lets you use the full programmatic power of JavaScript within HTML, and helps to keep your code readable. For the most part, `JSX` is similar to the HTML that you have already learned, however there are a few key differences that will be covered throughout these challenges.

For instance, because `JSX` is a syntactic extension of JavaScript, you can actually write JavaScript directly within `JSX`. To do this, you simply include the code you want to be treated as JavaScript within curly braces: `{ 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }`.

However, because `JSX` is not valid JavaScript, `JSX` code must be compiled into JavaScript. The transpiler [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is a popular tool for this process. For your convenience, it's already added behind the scenes.

It's worth noting that our `index.js` is calling `ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('root'))`. This function call is what places your `JSX` into React's own lightweight representation of the DOM. React then uses snapshots of its own DOM to optimize updating only specific parts of the actual DOM.
