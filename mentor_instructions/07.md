# Lifecycle methods

React components have several special methods that provide opportunities to perform actions at specific points in the lifecycle of a component. These are called lifecycle methods, or lifecycle hooks, and allow you to catch components at certain points in time. This can be before they are rendered, before they update, before they receive props, before they unmount, and so on. Here is a list of some of the main lifecycle methods: `componentWillMount()`,`componentDidMount()`, `shouldComponentUpdate()`, `componentDidUpdate(),` `componentWillUnmount()`. 

Most web developers, at some point, need to call an API endpoint to retrieve data. If you're working with React, it's important to know where to perform this action.

The best practice with React is to place API calls or any calls to your server in the lifecycle method `componentDidMount()`. This method is called after a component is mounted to the DOM. Any calls to `setState()` here will trigger a re-rendering of your component. When you call an API in this method, and set your state with the data that the API returns, it will automatically trigger an update once you receive the data.
