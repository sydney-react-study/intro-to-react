# Set State with this.setState

There is also a way to change the component's `state`. React provides a method for updating component `state` called `setState`. You call the `setState` method within your component class like so: `this.setState()`, passing in an object with key-value pairs. The keys are your state properties and the values are the updated state data. For instance, if we were storing a order in state and wanted to update it, it would look like this:

```js
this.setState({
  order: 'Cheeseburger'
});
```

React expects you to never modify `state` directly, instead always use `this.setState()` when `state` changes occur. Also, you should note that React may batch multiple `state` updates in order to improve performance. What this means is that `state` updates through the `setState` method can be asynchronous. There is an alternative syntax for the `setState` method which provides a way around this problem. This is rarely needed but it's good to keep it in mind! Please consult the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html) for further details.
