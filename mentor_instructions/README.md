## Introduction
Give a brief [introduction](01.md) and explain how to [thinking and understanding React Compments](02.md)

## Setup

1.  Create react app (`npx create-react-app emoji-eats`)
2.  Delete all unecessary files
3.  Replace `app.css` with [this](https://gist.github.com/ticidesign/12640a2a4b2587c94a25fd6552a315c0)
4.  Add google font to `index.html` (Go to public/index.html in your repo. Add the following <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,600" rel="stylesheet"> underneath the shortcut icon link element on line 13)

5.  Make file in folder src/data/menuData.js and copy code from [here](https://gist.github.com/ticidesign/23e63112790d9489b257d648608c9971)
6.  Run `yarn` if not already
7.  Delete all code in `App.js`
8.  [Create App component](03.md) from scratch - import react, create class, render, return, export default etc. 
9.  Explain [JSX](04.md) and mention it should be wrapped in an enclosing tag.

## Create Header component

1.  Make class component and later when we go over state we can make it a stateless functional component.
2.  Add the Header into `App.js`.

## Create MenuItem component

1.  Create another class component and hardcode the data for one menu item. Don't make the `handleClick` method yet.
2.  Explain how the component isn't reusable if we hardcode the data. To make it reuseable we need to use props. [Pass Props to a Stateless Functional Component](05.md)
3.  Import the menuData in the App.js file as well as the menuItem component. Add the following props to menuItem - emoji, label, name, description, price.
4.  Assign the data for the first item in the menuData to the props eg. `name={menuData[0].name}`
5.  Explain how we could have a menuItem in App.js for every item on our menu but this isn't very dynamic. So we want to use the map method so we can dynamically render a menuItem for every item in the data. Explanation for map is in the README. Make sure you update the `props` and add a `key` using the index.

## Adding state

1.  [Add state](06.md) to the App.js file (we add it to App.js because it's used in both menuItem and Order). Order will be an empty array and cost will be 0.
2.  Create the handleUpdate function in App.js. Explain parameters, arguments, setState and concatenate.
3.  The button is in MenuItem so when we click on the button we need to call the method in App.js. To do this we will need to pass the method to menuItem as a prop and call the prop with onClick.
4.  Use the react devtools to see state updating when the button is clicked.

## Order component

1.  Create the order component and only render the code for no items.
2.  To be able to display orders in the order component, we need to pass state down as props. Add an order and total prop and pass down state.
3.  We need to add a ternery operator or an if/else statement to check if we have any orders. If `order.length === 0`, we display the no items code.
4.  Add the remaining code that displays the ordered items. Try to get the students to guess that they need to use `map()` to display the items dynamically.
5.  Add the total section in the order component.
6.  Before adding the buttons, add the `resetOrder` method to app.js and pass this method to the order component as a prop.
7.  Add the reset button to the order component and test that it works.
8.  Add the `submitOrder` method to app.js and then pass the method down to Order and add the submit button to the order component.

## Lifecycle methods

1.  Briefly explain [lifecycle methods](07.md) and `componentDidMount` and how we will use it to fetch the menudata
2.  Add `componentDidMount` to `App.js` and create a `setTimeout` function that saves the menudata to state after 3 secs.
3.  Update state with data
4.  Create the loading component
5.  Add a ternary to display the loading if the data isn't ready

TODO:
## Refactor

1.  Update components that are not using state to stateless functional components
2.  Destructure state and props
3.  Add propTypes
4.  Use hooks
