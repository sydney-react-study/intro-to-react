# Thinking and Understanding React Compments

Everything in React is a compoment. Components let you split the UI into independent, **reusable pieces**, and think about each piece in isolation. 

Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

To see how a compoment works visit a website build in react, per example https://www.instagram.com/, open your dev tools by hitting Ctrl + Shift + J (on Windows) or Ctrl + Option + J (on Mac) in your keyboard. In you dev tools we will see a tag called `Compoments`, where you can explore all the compoments in that page and the `props` and `states` for each of these components.
