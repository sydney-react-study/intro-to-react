# Thinking and Understanding React Components

Everything in React is a component. Components let you split the UI into independent, **reusable pieces**, and think about each piece in isolation. 

Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

To see how a component works visit a website built in react, per example https://www.instagram.com/, open your dev tools by hitting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> (on Windows) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> (on Mac) in your keyboard. There you will see a tab called `Components`*, where you can explore all the components in that page and the `props` and `states` for each of these components.
