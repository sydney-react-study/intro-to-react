# Pass Props to a Stateless Functional Component

In React, you can pass `props`, or properties, to child components. Say you have an App component which renders a child component called MenuItem which is a stateless functional component. You can pass MenuItem a user property by writing:

```js
<App>
  <MenuItem name='Cheeseburger'/>
</App>
```

You use custom HTML attributes created by you and supported by React to be passed to the component. In this case, the created property user is passed to the component MenuItem. Since MenuItem is a stateless functional component, it has access to this value like so:

```js
const MenuItem = (props) => <div>I like {props.name}!</div>

```

It is standard to call this value props and when dealing with stateless functional components, you basically consider it as an argument to a function which returns JSX. You can access the value of the argument in the function body. With class components, you will see this is a little different.
